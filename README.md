# Bored Bot API - Scrimba Project

A simple API project that fetches data from a Scrimba API. Click the Get Random Activity button to view ideas that may relieve your boredom. Plus, view a random fun gif every time you click for a new activity.

**Credit**: This project was completed in the Frontend Developer Career Path course on Scrimba. The original project has the functionality to fetch data from a Scrimba API with minimal styles. I've since added my own styles.
